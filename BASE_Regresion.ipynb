Inicialmente, los valores cero en \"Ton.Azucar\" se reemplazan por valores faltantes. Luego, se imputan los valores nulos en \"Ton.Azucar\" y \"%Sac.Caña\" utilizando la media de los valores dentro de grupos definidos por las columnas \"Area Neta\" y \"Rdto\" respectivamente, seguido de un llenado final con la media global para asegurar la ausencia de valores faltantes. Adicionalmente, se calculan o mantienen los valores de \"TonUltCorte\", \"Ton.Azucar\", \"Rdto\" y \"TAH\" mediante el uso de la función np.where, aplicando fórmulas específicas cuando los valores originales son nulos o cero, y conservando los valores existentes en caso contrario.\n",
